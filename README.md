Hi!
To run my program, enter "python3 api.py" into the terminal in the folder that api.py is in. Make sure if Flask is not installed you do "pip install Flask" first. From there, it will start up the server, and you can send JSON inputs to the program. To end the server, press CTRL+C on the keyboard to quit. 
Enjoy!
